## What it is

In [cloud native](/cloud-native-apps/) computing, runtime refers to the environment where applications or services run. It includes the necessary components and resources to make software work in a cloud native setup.

## Problem it addresses

Traditional software applications often face challenges when deployed and executed in distributed environments like cloud platforms. 
These challenges include managing dependencies, scaling resources, handling failures, and ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
 

## How it helps

Runtime helps address these challenges by providing a standardized and containerized execution environment. 
It [abstracts](/abstraction/) away the underlying infrastructure details, enabling applications to be deployed and run consistently across different cloud platforms or environments. 
The runtime environment includes features like [container orchestration](container-orchestration/), automatic [scaling](/auto-scaling/), service discovery, and fault tolerance, simplifying the deployment, management, and scaling of applications.

A runtime allows developers to focus on building and shipping applications without worrying about specific infrastructure details. 
It provides [portability](/portability/), scalability, and resilience, allowing applications to dynamically adapt to changing conditions and handle increased workloads efficiently.
